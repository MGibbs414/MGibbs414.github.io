                        <span class="tab"></span> SRC scripts are a popular way to add or change features in the game Grand Theft Auto V. These scripts are written in the game's native language, which is C++, and 
                        are executed by the game's engine. SRC scripts can be used to add new vehicles, weapons, and missions, as well as modify existing gameplay mechanics. Some popular SRC 
                        scripts for Grand Theft Auto V include the Native Trainer, which allows players to spawn vehicles and weapons, and the Open All Interiors mod, which opens up previously 
                        inaccessible buildings in the game.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b><span class="tab"></span> However, it's important to note that using SRC scripts can potentially lead to issues with the game's stability and may even result in a ban from online play. It's 
                            recommended to use caution when modifying any game files and to only download SRC scripts from reputable sources. Additionally, players should always make backups of 
                            their game files before attempting any modifications</b>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span class="tab"></span> SRC scripts, also known as Script Hook V, have become increasingly popular among Grand Theft Auto V players as a way to enhance their gaming experience. These scripts are
                         written in C++, the game's native language, and are executed by the game's engine. With SRC scripts, players can not only add or change features in the game but also modify 
                         existing gameplay mechanics to their liking.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span class="tab"></span>One popular SRC script is the Native Trainer, which allows players to spawn vehicles and weapons, as well as change the time of day and weather conditions in the game. Another 
                        popular SRC script is the Open All Interiors mod, which opens up previously inaccessible buildings in the game and allows players to explore new areas. These SRC scripts, along 
                        with many others, can be easily downloaded from reputable sources online.
                        Despite the potential risks, many Grand Theft Auto V players continue to use SRC scripts as a way to add new vehicles, weapons, and missions to the game, as well as to modify 
                        existing gameplay mechanics. The possibilities with SRC scripts are endless, and with the right skills and knowledge, players can create their own custom mods to share with the 
                        gaming community.

                    <h2 class="mb-4">The bulk of the work</h2>
                    <img class="img-thumbnail p-3 w-50 float-left mr-4 mb-3" src="https://MGibbs414.github.io/resume/public_html/assets/imgs/code2.1.jpg" alt="code2.1">
                    <p>
                        <span class="tab"></span>When writing your own scripts for modded video games such as GTA, the bulk of the work typically involves coding your desired features and functionalities. 
                        This requires a good understanding of the game's existing code and mechanics, as well as an ability to create new code that can interact with the game's existing systems.
                        Writing scripts for modded video games such as Grand Theft Auto (GTA) can be a fun and rewarding experience for those interested in programming and game development. In order to 
                        write scripts for a modded game like GTA, you will typically need to have a basic understanding of programming concepts, particularly in the language that the modding community 
                        has chosen to use for that specific game. Once you have a basic understanding of the language being used for the game, you can begin writing your own scripts. These scripts can 
                        range from simple modifications to the game's existing mechanics, such as changing the weather or the time of day, to more complex modifications that add entirely new features to 
                        the game. One of the most popular languages used for modding GTA is C++. This language is commonly used for game development and is well-suited for creating game modifications. 
                        To write a script for a modded game like GTA, you will typically need to create a new file that contains your code, save it in a specific location, and then use a program like 
                        the Script Hook V library to load your script into the game.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span class="tab"></span>In addition to coding, you may also need to create new assets such as models, textures, or sound files to use in your mod. This requires a knowledge 
                        of 3D modeling software and sound editing software, as well as an ability to create high-quality assets that are consistent with the game's existing visual and audio styles.
                        Once you have created your code and assets, you will need to test your mod extensively to ensure that it works properly and does not introduce any 
                        game-breaking bugs or glitches. This can be a time-consuming process, as it often involves testing the mod on multiple different devices and with multiple different configurations.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span class="tab"></span>Finally, you will need to distribute your mod to other players. This can involve creating an installer or archive file that other players can download and 
                        install on their own systems, as well as creating documentation and instructions to help players get the most out of your mod. In addition to working on your own scripts and mods 
                        for modded game servers, there is often a strong sense of community involvement and collaboration within the modding community. This can involve working with other modders to share 
                        resources, ideas, and expertise, as well as working together to create more complex and ambitious mods. One common way that modders collaborate within the community is through the 
                        use of forums and other online communities. These communities provide a space for modders to share their work, provide feedback to others, and ask for help or advice when needed. 
                        This can be a great way to learn from other modders and to get inspired by the work of others. Another way that modders collaborate is through the use of open-source code libraries 
                        and resources. This can involve creating and sharing code snippets or entire scripts that other modders can use in their own mods, or creating and sharing assets such as textures, 
                        models, and sound files. Many modders collaborate by working together to create large-scale mods and game modifications. This can involve creating new game modes, introducing new 
                        mechanics or features, or even creating entirely new games using existing game engines. These collaborative projects can be some of the most ambitious and exciting projects within 
                        the modding community, and can involve dozens or even hundreds of modders working together to create something truly unique and innovative.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span class="tab"></span>Overall, the involvement of others within the modding community can be a key part of working on modded game servers. By collaborating with others, 
                        sharing resources and ideas, and working together on ambitious projects, modders can push the boundaries of what is possible in game development and create exciting new experiences 
                        for players to enjoy. Writing scripts for modded video games can be a challenging but rewarding experience. It requires a strong understanding of programming concepts, as well as 
                        the ability to think creatively and problem-solve in order to create engaging and interesting modifications for players to enjoy. For those interested in programming or game 
                        development, writing scripts for modded video games like GTA can be an excellent way to gain experience and explore the possibilities of game development.
